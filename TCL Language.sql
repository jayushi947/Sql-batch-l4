-- TCL --> transcation control language
-- It is used to manage transactions in a database.
-- to mantain data consistancy and integrity we use TCL.
-- Transaction ==> set of logoical statement ( permanent nahi hai )
-- update 
-- commit, rollback, savepoint

use gaurav;
create table actor_cp1 as select actor_id, first_name from sakila.actor
where actor_id between 1 and 5;


select * from actor_cp1;
insert into actor_cp1 values (6,'gaurav'); -- it will be save and we show it on other connection 

-- autocommit ==> enable 
set @@autocommit=1;
select @@autocommit;
insert into actor_cp1 values (7,'akash'); -- it not show in new connection because we desable autosave, it will be logical 

-- transaction starting 
-- In case if you run any DML operation or insert, update, delete, we write start transcation(statement) to start transcation--transcation start autometically, then transcation will start


-- autometically close transcation
-- commit or rollback 
-- if we write any ddl statement 
-- if we use any statement of TCL my transcation is closed commit, rollback
-- if i run any ddl operation create, drop, alter, will of transcation 

-- Commit
-- Saves all changes permanently

-- Rollback
-- Undoes changes since last COMMIT, disable all transcation and rollback to previous transcation, revert pending transcation
-- if we run commit, rollback was not work 

-- SavePoint
-- Creates a checkpoint inside a transaction
-- Rollback can happen up to a specific point


-- if we run any DDL statment transcation is disable and all will be auto save
